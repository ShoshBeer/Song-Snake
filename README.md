# Welcome to Song Snake!

## About

This app is based on the Codecademy Front-End Engineer project called 'Jamming', which is a hands-on project meant to start you working with APIs.

Since Spotify's algorithm excels at recommending music based on your listening habits, it can be hard to find new music in different genres. Song Snake can help!

You can also play some games - guess where the theme will go or try to get to a particular song from another one.

## How to Use

Start by typing something into the search field and clicking search. You will be redirected to the Spotify authentication page to get permission to access your Spotify account. Once you log in, you can play with Song Snake!

Search for anything you'd like and Spotify's search results will populate the results section. Click the plus to add a song to the playlist, and a new search will trigger automatically based on the song you added. Each song added will be related to the previous one by a single word. 

You can remove songs from the playlist with the minus button. 

Once you are happy with your playlist, give it a name and click Save to Spotify. The playlist can now be accessed from Spotify!
